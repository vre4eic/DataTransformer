# CERIF-Data-Transformer #

CerifDataTransformer is responsible for carrying out the transformation of data described with respect to the CERIF model (http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/feature-tour/cerif-16) from XML to their RDF equivalent expression.

For this reason, CerifDataTransformer uses X3ML engine (https://github.com/isl/x3ml) to carry out the transformation and the generation of the URIs (and other values).
